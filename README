This repository contains the enhanced version of Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher's graph-based image segmentation algorithm. This enhancement offers the added capability of using depth data from a depth image registered with the rgb one, as can be obtained from sensors like the Microsoft Kinect. Originally owned by user bhaskara, this repository is now maintained by user eventuo.
